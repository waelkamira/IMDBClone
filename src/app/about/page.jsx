        IMDb an acronym for Internet Movie Database is an online database of
        information related to films, television series, podcasts, home videos,
        video games, and streaming content online including cast, production
        crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan
        and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the
        Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993.
        Since 1998, it has been owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a
        subsidiary of Amazon.

        The site's message boards were disabled in February 2017. As of 2019,
        IMDb was the 52nd most visited website on the Internet, as ranked by
        Alexa.3 As of March 2022, the database contained some 10.1 million
        titles including television episodes, 11.5 million person records, and
        83 million registered users 4 Features The title and talent pages of
        IMDb are accessible to all users, but only registered and logged-in
        users can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries.
        Most of the site's data has been provided by these volunteers.
        Registered users with a proven track record are able to add and make
        corrections to cast lists, credits, and some other data points. However,
        the addition and removal of images, and alterations to titles, cast and
        crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an
        approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours. On October
        2, 2007,citation needed character filmographies were added. Character
        entries are created from character listings in the main filmography
        database, and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb
        staff.

        They have already been verified when they are added to the main
        filmography. Registered users can choose their username, and most are
        pseudonymous. There is no single index of contributors, no index on each
        profile page of the items contributed, and—except for plot synopses and
        biographies—no identification of contributors to each product's or
        person's data pages. Users are also invited to rate titles on a scale of
        1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating, with
        filters in place to mitigate ballot-stuffing. User profile pages show a
        user's registration date and, optionally, their personal ratings of
        titles. Since 2015, "badges" can be added showing a count of
        contributions. These badges range from total contributions made to
        independent categories such as photos, trivia, and biographies.

        If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has
        an IMDb page, they can add photos through IMDbPRO. User ratings of films
        As one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a rating scale that allows users
        to rate titles on a scale of one to ten. IMDb indicates that submitted
        ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways to produce a weighted
        mean that is displayed for each title. It states that filters are used
        to deter ballot stuffing; the methodology and details for how its
        ratings are calculated are confidential and not accessible to the
        public. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the
        weighted average and the arithmetic mean. Rankings The IMDb Top 250 is a
        list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered
        users of the website using the methods described.
